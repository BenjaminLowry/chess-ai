# My custom chess AI

This is the repository for the chess bot I have created using game theory and artificial intelligence. 

The bot uses my custom-created utility function for analyzing different scenarios in chess, and currently can look 4 moves ahead in about 30 seconds on average using my Macbook Pro. I am working to improve its efficiency so it can analyzing further ahead in the game.
